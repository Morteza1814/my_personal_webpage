  P I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department of University of Virginia (UVA) under supervision of #[a(href='https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/') Prof. Kevin Skadron].
  P My interests lie broadly in Computer Architecture, Domain Specific Accelerators, and Bioinformatics. Iâ€™m interested in exploring novel hardware and software techniques to enhance the performance, energy efficiency, and programmability of domain specific accelerators. I also have extensive experience in designing high-performance, energy-efficient embedded systems for core consumer products. You can find my CV #[a(href='files/Resume_Morteza_Baradaran_24.pdf') here].

<p>Recent highlights include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> Accelerating hybrid Transformer-CNN models for computer vision using Processing-in-Memory.</p>
  </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Processing in Mamory Framework:</strong> Designed and implemented a framework to simulate various processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures and benchmarks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Graph Analytics:</strong> Developed <em>TriPIM</em>, a scalable triangle counting large graphs efficiently using processing in memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bioinformatics:</strong> Created <em>PARMIK</em>, a fast and memory-efficient tool for identifying partial matches in genomic sequences, surpassing BLAST in speed and accuracy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cache Optimization:</strong> Enhanced graph caching with <em>ECG</em>, optimizing prefetching and replacement policies for graph analytics.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
